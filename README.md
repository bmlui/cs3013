# CS 3013 Operating Systems

This repository contains my work from the CS 3013 Operating Systems course at WPI. The course focused on the fundamentals of operating systems, from processes and threads to memory management and networking.

The assignments included programming exercises in C and Python, as well as written reports discussing the implementation of various concepts.

The assignments are organized into folders, each of which contains the code, documentation, and reports for that assignment.

In this course I learned about
- Processes and threads
- Synchronization and mutual exclusion
- Memory management
- Virtual memory
- File systems
- Networking
